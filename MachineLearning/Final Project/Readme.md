# This ipynb was developd in Google Colab, for the Final Project of the Machine Learning Postgraduate Course of Artificial Inteligence Master of CSD AUTH.
## The problem that I modeled here is an attempt to learn the rock-paper-scissors game.
* The enemy playes first, so we see an image of an action (rock/paper/scissors)
* Our model then tries to select the optimal action, which would make it win (so if the enemy played rock, then our model should choose paper)

### I trained my model using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors, where I also kept 20% of the dataset to test the model.
